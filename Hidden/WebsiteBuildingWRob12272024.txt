WEbsite creation:

Astro foundation on which to build sites, flexible
look and feel from a theme - (Starlight, etc, 

Step 1- looking for astro themes
	blog style? 
	showed Cat's website - many/ mostly pertinent features
		banner at top above menu? more minimalistic now? 
Tailwind?

	"Big hero" image just below the menu, which should be fine - changeable as new releases approach- (maybe by world, with covers of books on one side, world image background dominating the other side (left))



(((
Database- of books (covers, titles, blurbs, release dates, buy links)
  To be used:
     in a carousel on the home page
     On World and Genre pages to allow people to find the works online/read them on my site or Patreon, find chronologies, anecdotes, character and fan art, future releases, etc. (Future releases should also be their own page or on a calendar, possibly also on the home page as Cat has w/appearances, at least until I have enough appearances to fill that space and releases get bumped to the calendar page.

Maybe links ot resources for requesting my books from libraries
	also templates/ suggestions for how to write a review (a stumbling block for getting some people to do so?)


webspace w/Rob for now
No commitment to long term hosts(5-10yr poss)
Investment in building it.
)))






features:

Author portfolios
responsive design - mobile friendly nav menus/layout
carousel library - there's a component (github/claudiabdm/astro-crousel/blob/main/src/carouself.astro) 
	some inherent formatting, JS to run it, chain links and related images
	should be easy to add <A href>
	but does it move?
	use Swiper?(already included in Pinwheel) Pinwheel?- seems legit.

Discuss/comments available
using pnpm similar launch to edit /build/ test(dev)


pnpm install


node package managers- (npm, pnpm, yarn)

placing images- johntemp/public/images
  can add text before oor after (don't forget paragraph tags (<P>)

good for this theme- floating menu that stays at toip as you scroll downthe page, always accessible!

figuring it out:

Where is floating, seemingly separate from page- a component? yes, "pageheader.astro") menu defined? menu.jason / config.json
		includes place for logo, settings for length of summary

Starting small- what's the minimum viable product?
	((commenting things out/ coming soon pages))

Customizable 404 page!

Changelog (updates)

src/config has a lot of settings


mostly pages and images, links, 


best way to approach the diff worlds- YAML/frontmatter call to components for pages type-  "Worlds" etc.


diff content collections (not just "docs" as in Rob's site) can group these types in folders in content. (content in md/mdx, formatted with a layout (see [single].astro in career collection)
(container is a grid box, allows for pre-arranged boxes with diff info, border, color, font, etc -  maybe images on the side? - covers, characters, etc) in career: wide coolumn/thin column - keep backup of the page to refer to.

worlds
series
books
(maybe blogs)

github.com account, build monorepo

(loading the mono into github at above account) which will allow me to see it and mess with it?

pindraft (from pinwheel)


git pull https://github.com/JAMcColley/jamono.git

how do I get pnpm for VS Code/Github
.git is git storage

got something set up on Rob's computer where we can see (and build!) a dev server to experiment. 

currently built with npm, moving to pnpm (faster, tighter, less space taken on disc)

GitBash 

want to be able to type pnpm from anywhere, (corepack)




- take bits from other themes, like "paper"






(Rob will be in NH this weekend... $$?)
