!! - Psyhopomp novella (Drained)- Still on the list, now for Dark Matter Ink (van Uden)(new DL 7/7)(X missed that one, too, focusing on Geode right now... but Drained is still great, so we'll find a place for it, even if it's next time Pyschopomp opens up...)

*Sign up for online retrieval service for back up of data.(maybe get info from ROb about a solid one?)

*rough out sketch of the upside down pyramid thing (Adarap) for that D&D campaign to begin prep to use it as a source to create a scrap/trash model using straws and caps etc like that Howl's Moving Castle sculpt on YT.

Check out Apple Music for posting music(and maybe getting paid!) Will require some editing/creating new lists/ tracks of a certain length.(Looks like they require a Mac machine to upload- maybe the iPad? Otherwise, must use a third party middleperson to handle it. This would cost $ and maybe they take a cut on top?)
	-->So, other places? Tried to get into Tidal, but I'm not sure how to go about uploading.
